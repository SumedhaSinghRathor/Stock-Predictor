# Stock-Predictor
A full-stack web application that fetches historical stock data, stores it in a database, and uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to predict future stock prices. Built with Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and TensorFlow/Keras for the prediction logic.
